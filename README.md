# Reason React Todo

This is a small project to show off [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/), based on [Jared Forsyth's](https://jaredforsyth.com/2017/07/05/a-reason-react-tutorial/) fantastic tutorial, though it builds a bit on that original example.

Run this project:

```
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
